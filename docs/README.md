# Stochastic Differential Equations for Science and Engineering

This page contains supplementary information for my textbook, published by Taylor and Francis (CRC Press) in 2023.

View the [front page](Thygesen2023.jpg) or the [table of contents](TOC.pdf), or download the [preprint version](Thygesen%202023%20SDEs%20for%20science%20and%20engineering%20-%20PREPRINT.pdf) of the book. 

See the book at [Amazon](https://a.co/d/9KPknuO), at the [DTU bookstore](https://www.polyteknisk.dk/home/Detaljer/9781032232171) or at [Taylor and Francis](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003277569/stochastic-differential-equations-science-engineering-uffe-h%C3%B8gsbro-thygesen?context=ubx&refId=91568383-8f54-4388-961a-ffe3fdc2ac04). 

In the 	[repo](https://www.github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEbook), you can find:

* An [erratum](https://github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEbook/tree/main/Errata.pdf) 
* [Solutions to exercises](https://github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEbook/tree/main/Solutions) in the book
* [Source code](https://github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEbook/blob/main/code/TABLE.md) that generates the figures in the book
* [Additional exercise sheets](https://github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEbook/tree/main/Exercises) (with solutions)
* A [BibTeX entry](Thygesen2023sde.bib) for referencing the book.

The software uses my R toolbox for stochastic differential equations, [SDEtools](https://www.github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEtools).
