# Stochastic Differential Equations for Science and Engineering

This page contains supplementary information for my forthcoming textbook, to be published by Taylor and Francis (CRC Press) in 2023.

See the table of contents [here](TOC.pdf)

In the 	[repo](https://www.github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEbook), you can find:

* Solutions to exercises in the book
* Source code that generates the figures in the book
* Additional exercise sheets (with solutions)

The software uses my R toolbox for stochastic differential equations, SDEtools. Check out its [repo](https://www.github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEtools).
